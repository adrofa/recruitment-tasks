**Multiple Sim-Cards Owners Detection** | aug-2019 | [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrofa/recruitment-tasks/blob/master/multiple_sim_cards_owners_detection/multiple_sim_cards_owners_detection.ipynb) *(RUS)*
<br/>The notebook presents an algorithm identifying groups of sim-cards, which belongs to one personality. The algorithm is based on geodata from the stations, which transmit mobile signals. By submitting this solution I was offered with a DS position in Megafon (one of the largest Russian telecom companies).

**ML Task for Time** | jul-2019 | [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrofa/recruitment-tasks/blob/master/task_for_time/task_for_time.ipynb)
<br/>Less then in 3 hours, I passed through all of ML project stages: exploratory data analysis, features preparation, model selection, and model tuning. The trained model outperformed a naive algorithm, also important data insights were found. This task was a part of the recruiting process in a small German DS startup, which finally offered me the position of a DS.

**YouTube Video Info Parser** | jul-2019 | [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrofa/recruitment-tasks/blob/master/youtube_parser/youtube_parser.ipynb)
<br/>This is a simple example of a possible 'Youtube Data API V3' usage, which allows downloading main information about the stated video. The task had a time limitation - 4 hours. This task was an initial stage of a recruiting process in a small Russian firm, which uses AI to find out business opportunities in Asia. Due to my previous non-DS work experience, I was offered with a Head of Analytics position with business focus (I was interested in a more technical role).

**Steam Games Recommendations** | apr-2019 | [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrofa/recruitment-tasks/blob/master/steam_games_recommendations/steam_games_recommendations.ipynb)
